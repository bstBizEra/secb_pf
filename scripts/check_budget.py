"""Budget circuit breaker, minimal executable form.

AGENTS.md section 6 makes a reached budget cap a mandatory stop condition
and section 7 makes budget limits a required work-package field. This
script is the first slice of BUDGET_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_POLICY.md that can
actually trip: every pull request must declare a diff budget, and CI
fails the PR when the diff exceeds it.

Contract:

    stdin        output of ``git diff --numstat <base>...<head>``
    BUDGET_TEXT  the PR body, containing exactly one budget line:

        BUDGET: max_files=<int> max_lines=<int>

Exit codes (fail-closed, AGENTS.md section 4):

    0  diff is within the declared budget
    2  budget missing, malformed, declared twice, or exceeded

Counting rules: every changed path counts as one file. Lines are added
plus deleted. Binary files report no line counts in numstat ("-"); they
count as one file and zero lines, so a binary-heavy PR is bounded by
max_files rather than silently unbounded.
